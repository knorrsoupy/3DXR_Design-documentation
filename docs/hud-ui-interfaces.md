# **HUD & UI Interfaces**

User interfaces in XR differ from traditional 2D screens. This section covers best practices for designing **HUD elements, diegetic UI, and interactive menus**.

## **1. Types of UI in XR**
### **1.1 Diegetic UI**
- UI elements integrated **within the environment**.
- Examples: Holographic displays, VR wrist menus.

### **1.2 Non-Diegetic UI**
- Floating overlays **separate from the 3D world**.
- Examples: Health bars, notifications.

### **1.3 Spatial UI**
- Fixed panels that **exist within the scene**.
- Examples: Interactive kiosks, floating buttons.

## **2. HUD Design Principles**
- **Minimalist Design**: Avoid clutter to keep focus on the environment.
- **Scalability**: UI should adapt based on distance & user movement.
- **Contrast & Readability**: High contrast ensures visibility in different lighting conditions.

**Well-designed HUDs and UI improve usability and immersion in XR.**
