# Core Concepts

XR design requires a balance of **usability, immersion, and performance**. This section covers the fundamental principles that guide our **3D XR Design System**.

## **1. Design Philosophy**
- **User-Centered**: Prioritizing natural interactions and accessibility.
- **Immersive & Diegetic**: UI elements should blend into the environment when possible.
- **Scalable**: Components should adapt to different hardware and user needs.

## **2. Interaction Models**
### **Hand & Controller-based Interaction**
- **Raycasting**: UI interactions using laser pointers.
- **Direct Touch**: Hands physically interacting with UI elements.

### **Gaze-Based Interaction**
- **Dwell-based Selection**: Users can select elements by looking at them for a fixed duration.
- **Context-aware UI**: UI elements appear dynamically based on user focus.

### **Gesture & Voice Input**
- **Hand Gestures**: Swipes, pinches, and grabs for interaction.
- **Voice Commands**: Hands-free control using speech recognition.

These principles guide the systemâ€™s **navigation, UI, and interaction** components.
