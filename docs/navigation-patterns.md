# Navigation Patterns

Navigation is crucial in XR, ensuring **comfort, accessibility, and efficiency**. This section covers different movement techniques and menu placement strategies.

## **1. Locomotion Methods**
### **1.1 Teleportation**
- Best for **reducing motion sickness**.
- Uses an arc-based pointer for destination selection.

### **1.2 Continuous Movement**
- Joystick-controlled movement similar to traditional games.
- Can cause motion sicknessâ€”use vignette effects to reduce discomfort.

### **1.3 Hybrid Movement**
- Combines **teleportation & joystick movement**.
- Useful for applications requiring **precise & large-scale movement**.

## **2. UI & Menu Placement**
### **2.1 Fixed UI Panels**
- Static UI elements positioned in the environment.
- Good for dashboards and HUDs.

### **2.2 Floating UI**
- UI elements attached to the player (e.g., wrist menus).
- Ideal for contextual menus in VR.

### **2.3 World-locked UI**
- UI elements placed within the world (e.g., holographic displays).
- Provides a **realistic** and **immersive** feel.

Choosing the right **navigation & UI placement** enhances the **XR experience**.
