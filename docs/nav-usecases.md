# **Usecases and Components**
These are some of the use cases identified for the **XR Design System for navigation** in in a virtual world. This list is not exhaustive and may evolve as new types and patterns are discovered in the future.

## **Use Cases**
<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### **Straight Path**
    ---
    ![Path](./assets/images/navigation%20images/Path.png){ width="180" }  
    A directional indicator that guides the user towards a designated target or a destination.

-   ### **Turning**
    ---
    ![Turning Left](./assets/images/navigation%20images/Turning.png){ width="180" }  
    A directional indicator that guides the user towards a designated target or destination when there is a change in the path's direction.

-   ### **Staircase**
    ---
    ![Staircase](./assets/images/navigation%20images/stair.png){ width="180" }  
    Users must navigate staircases smoothly in XR without discomfort or disorientation. Indicator to show stairs is needed.

-   ### **Ramp Case**
    ---
    ![Ramp](./assets/images/navigation%20images/ramp-case.png){ width="180" }  
    The design system should support gradual elevation changes, seamless locomotion, and clear visual cues to prevent disorientation and enhance immersion.

-   ### **Caution Indicator**
    ---
    ![Caution Indicator](./assets/images/navigation%20images/Caution_Mark.png){ width="180" }  
    In environments such as factories, potential hazards may arise. A caution indicator is essential to alert users to these dangers, ensuring safe navigation within the virtual world.

-   ### **Narrow Path Indicator**
    ---
    ![Narrow Path Indicator](./assets/images/navigation%20images/narrow-path.png){ width="180" }  
    An indicator to alert users when navigating through narrow paths, ensuring they are aware of the restricted space and can proceed with caution.

-   ### **Destination / Target**
    ---
    ![Destination Indicator](./assets/images/navigation%20images/Destination.png){ width="180" }  
    An indicator is needed to clearly mark the destination or target, guiding users to their intended endpoint within the virtual environment.

-   ### **Heavy Object**
    ---
    ![Heavy Object Indicator](./assets/images/navigation%20images/Heavy_Object.png){ width="180" }  
    Users should be alerted when they are carrying a heavy object to ensure they handle it with care and maintain proper posture to avoid strain or injury.
